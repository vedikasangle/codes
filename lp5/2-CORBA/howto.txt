LPV Assignment No : 3 
Problem Statement : - To develop any application with CORBA program JAVA IDL
Step1 : - Install JAVA (JDK) version 1.8
Step2 :- Check for the idlj in the C:/Program Files/Java/JDK/bin
Step3 :- Add jdk’s bin folder path to environment variable (ex- C:/Program Files/Java/JDK/bin)
Step4 :- Create a Interface for Java
a)	For example Calc.idl
Include the following code in the idl file
module CalcApp
{
	interface Calc
	{
		exception DivisionByZero {};

		float sum(in float a, in float b);
		float div(in float a, in float b) raises (DivisionByZero);
		float mul(in float a, in float b);
		float sub(in float a, in float b);
	};
};
Step5 :- Create two java files 

Step6 :- Compile the Calc.idl file. 
a)	Command :– idlj  –fall Calc.idl
b)	This will create the CalcApp module
c)	Running this command will create a module with the following files in it.
 

Step7:- Compile all the java files 
	Command :-    javac *.java CalcApp/*.java
Step8:- Initialize the ORB with the following command and with initial port 1050
	Command:- orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050
 
Step9:- Execute the server code with the following command
	Command :- java CalcServer -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost
 
Step10:- Execute the client code with the following command
	Command :- java CalcClient -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost
 

Conclusion : We have implemented a distributed application using CORBA programming and JAVA IDL.
