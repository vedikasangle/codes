To create a React.js application using React hooks, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up a new React project using Create React App. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
npx create-react-app react-hooks-example

This will create a new directory called react-hooks-example with the basic structure and files for a React application.

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory:

cd react-hooks-example

Step 3: Replace the contents of src/App.js with the following code:

Step 4: Create a new file called src/Counter.js and add the following code:

Step 5: Start the development server by running the command:
npm start

This will run your React application and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

You now have a basic React application set up with a Counter component that uses the useState hook to manage the count state. The App component renders the Counter component and displays it in the browser.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code to add more functionality and components to your React application using React hooks.
